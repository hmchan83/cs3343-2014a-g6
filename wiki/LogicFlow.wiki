#summary Logic

= Preparation =
 Controller.!ListController will be used to prepare a "usable" !ArrayList with data that require in main logic.
  # the Priority number
    * used to determinate the priority with a integer
    * Priority follow the input order of course and section
    * Example : 
{{{
2
CS0001 TEST1 2
C01 Fri 1200 1300 LT6 12345 3
C02 Mon 1100 1200 LT8 12346 3 
CS0002 TEST2 1
C01 Fri 1200 1300 LT6 12347 3
}}}
   The course CS0001 will be given a priority number 2, and CS0002 is 1;<br>
   The section C01 of CS0001 will be given a priority number 2, and C02 is 1;<br>
   Hence the priority number of CS0001 C01 is 22, C02 is 21 and CS0002 C01 is 11.
  # Conflict Number
    * This number representing the number of course that the section conflict with.
    * For each section in course A, if it conflict with any section in Course B, it conflict number will add 1.(no matter how many sections it conflicted)


= Main Logic =
==Selecting Course==
  # follow the order of input
  # check if any section can be selected
----
==Selecting Section==
  # 2 set of rules, Simple & Complex
  # if the input follow the following rule, Simple Handler will be use, otherwise the Complex Handler will be use
     * only 2 courses
     * only one section of the course has the min. conflict number

===Simple Method===
  # consider the conflict number (the number that the course will conflict with this section, See ProjectTerms)
  # and then consider the priory

===Complex Handler(developing)===
*ALL OF THE CONTENTS AT THIS PART MAY BE CHANGE*
  # find out sections that have the smallest conflict number
  # trying to select this section and continuous to handler the next course
  # store the result list and find the result contains highest Priority
